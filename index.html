		<p class="poem">
			For every parcel I stoop down to seize<br>
			I lose some other off my arms and knees,<br>
			And the whole pile is slipping, bottles, buns â€”<br>
			Extremes too hard to comprehend at once,<br>
			Yet nothing I should care to leave behind.<br>
			With all I have to hold with hand and mind<br>
			And heart, if need be, I will do my best<br>
			To keep their building balanced at my breast.<br>
			I crouch down to prevent them as they fall;<br>
			Then sit down in the middle of them all.<br>
			I had to drop the armful in the road<br>
			And try to stack them in a better load.
